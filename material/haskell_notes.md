# Functional Programming

- is about creating programs without side effects
	- by using pure functions
		- means: same set of parameters always results in the same output and no variables outside of the function's scope are changed

## Other properties:

- declarative type of programming style
- recursion -> no loops required


## General Information

- is used for Facebook spam filter (Haskell), WhatsApp (Erlang), Twitch (Scala)

- haskell comes from 'haskell b. curry', did stuff with lambda calculus


## Haskell/Functional Features:

- Monads (see list ops)
- Set Comprehension
- Type Inference (variables don't need to be declared, haskell infers them on its own)
- Pattern Matching
- Lazy Evaluation
- Recursion (If you still don't know what recursion is, read this sentence.)
- Higher Order Functions
